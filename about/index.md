Who am I?

I'm a Computer Scientist currently living in Dublin, Ireland. Nowadays I'm working as a Game Programmer at Black Shamrock Studios. The ideia of creating this blog is to discuss Programming, and also to put sometimes my personal opinion about non-related topics such as comics, mangas, photography, music and so on.

Personally I also try to learn music ( Bass, guitar and Ukulele basically ), I'm addicted to Mangas, I'm trying to take good photos with my cameras and planning new travels.
